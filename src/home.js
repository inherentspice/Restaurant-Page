      "description": "AI Restaurant: God's Favourite Mistake.  Ever had? Had to be there at night. \
       Some of these places open up hours before. I'd leave early to go to the park and/or eat at a \
       nearby restaurant before going to bed.  It was a lot less convenient to be on your phone at \
       night. Now, imagine that they will leave hours later at 6am to go home. Same thing happens with \
       rumpleisure and other places where you can rest assured that you will be there at all times. \
       It's unfortunate that this happened, but it illustrates the point that there are benefits to \
       staying in bed at night.  Like bed rest is essential, and if you are going to stay occupied at \
       night, then the best thing to do is to sleep wherever you want. There are a lot of pros to bed \
       rest that I've not mentioned here, so just ignore them. No bed. No sheets. No pillow. No chair. \
       No pillow. Oh, yeah. Itâ€™s all relative. Different sounds need different people. Different bed \
       sheets. Different hair. Different rug. Bed rest is absolutely essential if you want to stay \
       focused and recover after a difficult day. And if you want to rest after a difficult day, then \
       help strengthen the bed with your meds. Some people are good at it, some people are not. Some \
       people tense it too much, some people tense it too late. Some people tense it wrongly, some \
       people tense it wrongly, some people just don't teach me. Some of these are signs of bad training,\
       but most of the times I find myself doing things better after correcting my habits.  Like going for \
       a run/bike rides, doing pushups, standing in line, etc.  That sort of thing.  So I find myself doing \
       these habits after correcting my habits, and the more I correct my routines the better I get.  Like \
       hammering away at my problem, the more I find the motivation to fix them.  This is a very personal \
       kind of training, and I would like to think that there are people who are still not good at it after \
       correcting their routines.  Helping out is often about helping people, not about learning from them.  \
       Most of us are still not good at it, but it's very important to learn from those people.  It's not \
       easy to do, but it's not impossible.  Thanks for the motivation!"
